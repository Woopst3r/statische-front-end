        <h2 id="Who am ">Who is Jussef?</h2>
        <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to get to know me! My name is Jussef, and I am a Software developer based in Netherlands Dordrecht.

            From a young age, I have always been fascinated by machinery and how they function, and this passion has driven me to pursue a career in this field. Over the years, I have honed my skills through a combination of education, training, and hands-on experience, and I am continually seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow.
            
            I am someone who is dedicated, hard-working, and always striving for excellence. I believe in taking a collaborative approach to my work, and I value open communication, feedback, and constructive criticism. My ultimate goal is to use my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the world, whether it be through creating innovative solutions, inspiring others to pursue their passions, or contributing to a larger cause.
            
            When I'm not working, you can often find me gaming with my friends and going to the gym, or spending time with my family and my pet. I believe that having a healthy work-life balance is essential for personal and professional fulfillment, and I make a conscious effort to prioritize self-care and relaxation.</p>
